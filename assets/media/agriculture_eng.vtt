WEBVTT

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.670
We believe only innovation and partnerships can make sustainable agriculture a reality.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.710
We need to minimize our climate footprint.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.070
We need to reduce the impact of crop protection on the environment,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.750
and we must enable smallholders to boost local food production

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.430
while we improve soil health and biodiversity around the globe.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.110
We need... nothing less than to radically change how we grow and produce our food.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.470
We believe we can achieve better harvests while also

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.350
producing more food with less land and fewer resources,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.990
helping to tackle climate change and feeding more people while protecting our planet.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.710
Join us in this journey and learn more about our initiatives and solutions.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.910
Together we can shave the future of sustainable agriculture.
